# verty
An email application that I made at its most minimal.

## TL;DR 
This is only a prototype, so don't expect it to be a fully-scaled project; also, it is not hosted, and the GIF above is a rendition of the Verty application. I made this open-source, so you can look and help me on this project to extend Verty!

## Why I made this
I made this mail application as a passion project to enhance my full-stack skills by learning new languages such as SQL and PHP. This turned out to be a success, and I embark on trying to develop and create something similar to this in the future.

## Highlights

- A simple (open-source) HTML email application
- No ads
- Hosted purely from Raspberry Pi

# How I made Verty
I created the web application with a LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB/MySql & Perl) and PHP. It was tough mapping out the pages, links, and database for the accounts system, but in the end, the website turned quite well!

## How to visit demo?

As this was mapped locally for my Raspberry Pi, you can get the demo by entering:

```
git clone https://github.com/VihaanVinoth/verty.git
cd verty
```

However, the main login page can be viewed by visiting the ```index.html```.

> [!WARNING]
> If you choose to ```git clone``` the file, some areas might be broken and return errors, such as no ```.env``` file. I will look into this issue, and create a solution so you can access the real web application. Also, as this is open-source, you can help me by contributing to the documentation, and to resolving the problems as well.
